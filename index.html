                  Arthur and Merlin lived a happy life at the Linden, a LUXURY
                  high-rise flat in Downtown Long Beach.

                  They loved the building very much but they also had a strong
                  desire to DRIVE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So one day they took their loving and beautiful owner,
                  Alissa’s, keys to her BLACK Mini Cooper and decided to find
                  what they could find.

                  Arthur and Merlin entered Sweetwater and all eyes turned to
                  face them. A few people were vaping inside. Luckily Arthur
                  took some cash from Alissa because this bar is CASH ONLY.

                <p>
                  Arthur ordered a vodka-cranberry and Merlin REFUSED to drink
                  alcohol like Effie.

                  But then their big day out was COMPROMISED because Arthur saw
                  a cute Cavalier King Charles Spaniel across the bar... he was
                  there with his GAY owner.

                  said Merlin. Merlin is a rule-follower and doesn’t like to

                  grabbed a loosie stuck in the ugly stucco and stone wall
