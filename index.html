                  The ways of githook test in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our
                  ways; nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to
                  the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works,
                  which have a depth in them greater than the well of
                  Democritus.

                  WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some
                  minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.

                  "Not long ago," said he at length, "and I could have guided
                  you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but,
                  about three years past, there happened to me an event such as
                  never happened to mortal man&mdash;or at least such as no man
                  ever survived to tell of&mdash;and the six hours of deadly
                  terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul.
                  You suppose me a
                  <i>very</i> old man&mdash;but I am not. It took less than a
                  single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white,
                  to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I
                  tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow.
                  Do you know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without
                  getting giddy?"

                  The "little cliff," upon whose edge he had so carelessly
                  thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his
                  body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the
                  tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery
                  edge&mdash;this "little cliff" arose, a sheer unobstructed
                  precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen
                  hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would
                  have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In
                  truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous position of my
                  companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung
                  to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at
                  the sky&mdash;while I struggled in vain to divest myself of
                  the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in
                  danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could
                  reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out
                  into the distance.

                  "You must get over these fancies," said the guide, "for I have
                  brought you here that you might have the best possible view of
                  the scene of that event I mentioned&mdash;and to tell you the
                  whole story with the spot just under your eye."

                  "For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and
                  all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I
                  could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still
                  keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear.
                  Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog
                  does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some
                  measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of
                  the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so
                  as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my
                  arm. It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for
                  I had made sure that he was overboard&mdash;but the next
                  moment all this joy was turned into horror&mdash;for he put
                  his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word
                  '<i>Moskoe-ström!</i>'
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I
                  shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit
                  of the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well
                  enough&mdash;I knew what he wished to make me understand. With
                  the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of
                  the Ström, and nothing could save us!
