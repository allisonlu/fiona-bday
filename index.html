              Arthur and Merlin lived a happy life at the Linden, a LUXURY
              high-rise flat in Downtown Long Beach.

              They loved the building very much but they also had a strong
              desire to DRIVE.
            </p>
            <p>
              So one day they took their loving and beautiful owner, Alissa’s,
              keys to her BLACK Mini Cooper and decided to find what they could
              find.

              They didn’t drive far before they came upon the GAYBORHOOD. They
              passed the Falcon (too grunge), the Brit (too sexy), and finally
              came upon SWEETWATER - perfect!

              Arthur and Merlin entered Sweetwater and all eyes turned to face
              them. A few people were vaping inside. Luckily Arthur took some
              cash from Alissa because this bar is CASH ONLY.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arthur ordered a vodka-cranberry and Merlin REFUSED to drink
              alcohol like Effie.

              But then their big day out was COMPROMISED because Arthur saw a
              cute Cavalier King Charles Spaniel across the bar... he was there
              with his GAY owner.
